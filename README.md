# DualContouringTest
reference code, won't compile 'as is'
contains a (hopefully) easy-to-follow implementation of Adaptive (octree-based) Dual Contouring, but without the QEF simplification part.
"dual_contouring2.cpp" also implements "An Efficient Parametric Algorithm for Octree Traversal" [2000].

It relies on QEF/SVD code written by /u/unzret (on reddit.com) which can be obtained from:
