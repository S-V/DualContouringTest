# DualContouringTest
reference code, won't compile 'as is'
contains a (hopefully) easy-to-follow implementation of Adaptive (octree-based) Dual Contouring, but without the QEF simplification part.
"dual_contouring2.cpp" also implements "An Efficient Parametric Algorithm for Octree Traversal" [2000].
