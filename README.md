# DualContouringTest
reference code, won't compile 'as is'
contains a (hopefully) easy-to-follow implementation of Adaptive (octree-based) Dual Contouring, but without the QEF simplification part.
"dual_contouring2.cpp" also implements "An Efficient Parametric Algorithm for Octree Traversal" [2000].


The QEF/SVD code was taken from:
https://github.com/nickgildea/DualContouringSample

It says that the QEF implementation was written by /u/unzret (on reddit.com).
